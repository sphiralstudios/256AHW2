Homework #2 for Music 256A 

by Mark Hertensteiner

Synth in Polor Coordinates with low-pass resonant filter and reverb.

Angle (theta) is chroma, distance from center (radius) mapped to octave.

Background color is mapped to Chroma.  The thought just occurred to me that saturation could have also mapped to radius for an additional dimension of this effect.

Filter cutoff frequency mapped to radius length.

Known issues:

Some smoothing had to be removed to preserve passing of freqency and gain values between the two saw oscillators.  As a result there is a quiet click that can be heard when this happens, owing to the use of spectral-rich saw wave oscillators.
